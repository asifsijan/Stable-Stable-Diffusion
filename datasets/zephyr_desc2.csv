The Indri (Indri indri) is a large, lemur-like primate found only in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. With a distinctive white fur coat and black eyes, this endangered species communicates through a unique vocalization called a ""beroha,"" which is a deep, resonant call often described as sounding like a bellowing moan or a loud, mournful cry. Indris are arboreal and primarily herbivorous, feeding on the leaves and bark of trees in their habitat. They are social animals, living in small family groups and engaging in playful behaviors such as wrestling and chasing. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, population declines, and other threats, the Indri is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."

The female fish are much larger than the males and have a bite-shaped structure called a clasper on their head that they use to attach to the male's body for nutrition, as the males are too small to hunt on their own. The symbiotic relationship between the sexes is called parasitic sexuality. The first X-ray images of these enigmatic creatures were taken by researchers in 2019, revealing their unique anatomy and behavior."
