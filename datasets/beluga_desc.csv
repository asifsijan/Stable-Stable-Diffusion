I think my whole idea is that Rooster is a larger-than-life character, with crazy hair, a big weapon, and a wonky sense of humor. To that end, here's a possible video game boss battle involving our fearsome foul-tempered friend.

"Short description of Turkish Angora (cat breed)
The Turkish Angora (pronounced AN-jo-ra) is one of the most ancient breeds of domesticated cats. Similar to the Turkish Van, it is native to Turkey and was a firm favorite among Ottoman royals. The breed was so highly valued that they were frequently shipped as gifts throughout Europe, South America and Africa. In each new location, the breed was referred to by the name of the country they were shipped to (for instance, the “Anatolian Cat” when in Italy). Its name comes from the modern Turkish city of Ankara, previously called Angora.
The Turkish Angora is characterized by the long, silky coat that gives this breed its characteristic appearance. It does not shed, making it an excellent choice for allergy sufferers. Average mature male weight is 8 to 12 pounds, and females weigh 5 to 8 pounds. Turkish Angoras have a very outgoing personality, and they like human company; thus, they can get quite depressed if left alone for long periods of time.

"Short description of Lancaster Bomber: This is a rather lengthy book, and I have been trying to organise my thoughts on it for a little while. In essence, though, I’d describe it as a detailed account of the design, development and deployment of one of the RAF’s most celebrated aircraft, the Lancaster Bomber. Written by Robert Taylor, a renowned aviation artist, the book offers a unique perspective on the bomber as it is filled with detailed illustrations of the aircraft, its components and crew.
Apart from the technical aspects, Taylor also covers the human element of the Lancaster’s story. The work is in effect both a history of the aircraft and a tribute to the men who served in it. Both the words and pictures really capture the atmosphere of what it must have been like to fly and fight in the big bomber and, while it might not be a page turner in the traditional sense, I have no doubt that this will be a valuable reference work for anyone interested in the history of the RAF or aircraft development.

The Japanese Chin is one of the most highly regarded dogs in Japan. These small companion dogs usually sport a darkly-colored eye and vibrant coats of black and white or various shades of red.
This breed is known for its friendly demeanor, mild-mannered personality, and devotion to its family.

"Short description of Malayan Tiger (re-titled by someone else)
Rough synopsis of Malayan Tiger
Review of Malayan Tiger
After reading a book titled Lost Time which was reviewed here, I purchased a copy of this book titled Malayan Tiger (归阙之百吨风暴，归阙之贱资，归阙之大猫) written by the same author. Before you ask, no, I did not know I was purchasing a Chinese book written by this author. It was only until I got home and began to read the book that I realized this. Anyway, for the most part, Malayan Tiger is an enjoyable read, especially for lovers of action packed suspense novels. The plot, while being rather cliché, keeps the reader engaged and thirsty for more. The book will remind you a bit of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels, for those who are familiar with Tom Clancy's works.

"Short description of MuleEventBroker class
main() creates a component here and starts the same. It eventually begins listening for events and forwards them to the client. The registration of listeners with this MuleEventBroker is not done explicitly using a MuleClient, but is done using a table of EventSubscriptions which contains an identifier for each subscriber and a callback function to be invoked when the event occurs.
As an example, imagine that Event A occurs and both subscribers receive the event. When that happens, the broker gets two callbacks, one from subscriber A and one from subscriber B. Each callback takes in the event as a parameter, and performs some processing based on the specific requirements of the subscriber.
It is important to mention that this model assumes that the broker is stateless, meaning that it has no concept of a specific client or subscriber. If needed, this can be adjusted and implemented by adding a Client ID to the callback and associating it with each subscription.

"Short description of Scarlet Ibis (below) by the editors of eNotes, together with its place in the novel and significance to the story.
Scarlet Ibis by James Hurst is a short story about a man reflecting on a childhood event involving his relationship with his younger, physically weaker brother, Doodle. The narrator and Doodle were an unlikely pair, with their striking differences in personality and abilities. They decide to explore the wilderness, but Doodle finds it difficult to keep up with the narrator. As a result, the narrator forces Doodle to push himself beyond his abilities and keep up with him, eventually leading to Doodle's tragic death. The story highlights the dangers of pushing one's limits, the idea of innocence lost, and the delicate balance between individualism and protection. It is an integral part of the novel, and its significance lies in the reflective and poignant tone that reveals the impact of the narrator's actions on himself, Doodle, and their relationship.

"Short description of Goshawk's role and the change she implemented.
Goshawk implemented the strongest raids against the original video game; Chernobylite.
I found a bug in an NPC response, where the player was able to do something that would be impossible in real life and affect the NPC. I reported the bug to the developers of the video game, Chernobylite.
In the game, a character, Pavel, would respond to the player (if the player has taken any actions, which in this case they didn't). The error allowed the player to do something which, in real life, would not be possible.
The consequence of the bug was that the player could access a location in the video game without meeting the required conditions to do so. As a result, there would be discrepancies in the storyline and interactions with NPCs in the affected area, making the game difficult to progress.
I found out about the bug while playing the video game and had to provide more information on how the issue was reproducible by using a walkthrough. After submitting the report, I was provided with a status update, and the issue was later resolved in the game's patch."

"Short description of Horn Shark
Horn sharks (Heterodontus francisci) are found in the shallow waters of the coastal and inshore waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja, Mexico to Washington. They often live near kelp beds and rocky ledges. Horn sharks have a flat, broad, diamond-shaped body that can grow up to 3 feet long. They have five pairs of gill slits on each side of their head and a dorsal fin that runs nearly the length of their body. Unlike other sharks, horn sharks have small dorsal and pelvic fins and do not have anal or pectoral fins.
Horn sharks are ambush predators, meaning they wait quietly in the sand or kelp for unsuspecting prey to approach them. Then they quickly attack and devour the victim. Their primary food source includes crustaceans, fish, and octopuses. Horn sharks are ovoviviparous, which means their eggs are fertilized inside the female and hatch inside the uterus before they are born.
This shark has a low reproductive rate due to the relatively long gestation"

"Short description of Zebroid (generic term for Zebra hybrids)
A zebroid is a hybrid offspring of any species in the genus Equus (horse family) crossed with a zebra. A zebroid should not be confused with a zedonk, which is a hybrid cross between a zebra and a donkey, or a zony, which is a cross between a zebra and a zebra. Since zebroids have at least 25% equine DNA, they are often referred to as zebras since they resemble true zebras. Some breeders have successfully interbred zebras, producing offspring with varying degrees of zebra-like markings.
Unfortunately, while some zebroids have been known to produce babies with wild zebra DNA, in the majority of cases, breeders are forced to use artificial insemination or crosses between closely related horses. And that's a shame, since the animals are often beautiful to look at and have few health problems, making them great candidates for domestication. But the fact remains that while zebroids are fascinating animals with their own unique history and characteristics, they are not suited for most modern equine"

"Short description of Pintail Duck
The Pintail Duck (Anas acuta) is a bird species in the family of dabbling ducks. The common name comes from its pointed, long tail feathers. It is a dabbling duck, which means that it mainly feeds by sucking in the substrate of the water while its head is submerged.
Pintail Duck's features
The Pintail Duck is an excellent swimmer, which is in many ways attributable to its wide feet that it uses for swimming, diving, and walking. Its long, pointed tail is an excellent means of balance and also of streamlining in the water. In the case of dabbling ducks, the front part of their bill is shorter than their bill. This enables them to use their tongues to probe the mud. The male Pintail Duck has a dark metallic green head and neck with a vertical white line above the eyes.

The coat is dense and its wooly texture protects the dog from moisture and harsh weather. The coat needs regular maintenance, and should not be shaved.

"Short description of Tree Kangaroo
Tree Kangaroo is a particularly rare and exotic animal, especially for Europeans, because it looks like a smaller version of the famous and well-known Australian kangaroos. However, the tree kangaroo has unique characteristics and a completely different biology. As its name suggests, it lives mostly in trees and has better climbing abilities than ground-based species. Due to the fact that it spends most of its life in trees, the tree kangaroo has very long legs and a strong tail for good support and balance. Therefore, when searching for food on the ground, tree kangaroos use their clawed toes to dig and search. Their unique appearance, with their long tail and long limbs, makes this animal very unusual and popular among visitors to European zoos and animal parks.

Lifespan (in wild): 12 – 15 years

Zebrafish is a genetically transparent vertebrate, widely used for studying the biology of various diseases in the human body. Microarray technology is highly effective in understanding the genetic basis of several aspects of the biological processes occurring in Zebrafish.
Microarray analysis is an efficient method for genetic-based gene expression profiling. This method, also known as DNA chips or DNA microarrays, use glass slides or silicon materials, coated with specific DNA fragments that attach themselves to complementary strands in a sample of messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA is generated from a gene in response to a specific trigger, such as expression, control, and environment. When mRNA sample interacts with the microarray, it produces a high-dimensional DNA data matrix, which captures the information about the cellular processes occurring in a particular sample.
Genes belonging to a specific group share similar patterns of expression, suggesting that they might serve similar functions or be regulated by the same environmental factors. This method of profiling helps in uncovering biologically relevant information, which is valuable for studying the functions of genes and understanding the path"

"Short description of Parrotfishes
Not only the most colourful, but also the largest family of coral reef fishes. Parrotfishes are known from shallow waters worldwide with a strong preference for coral reefs. Almost all are herbivorous, feeding on seaweeds, algae, and corals. Their thick lips are used to scrape these off the reefs and the teeth are used to chew the vegetation.
Parrotfishes have a fascinating social system: they form large groups during their lives, which split from time to time into smaller groups of males and females. The males remain in these groups for breeding, while the females leave to give birth in a clean and predator-free area. After a few weeks, they join the males in the parent group again.
Parrotfishes sometimes change colour from black to blue, and bright colours help them to find partners, avoid predators, and communicate with each other.

"Short description of Koala Castle:
After creating a good foundation with The Backyardigans, Angela C. Santomero's creativity grew further and eventually resulted in one of the most popular kid's shows of all time, Blue's Clues. But before that, she developed a similar show called Koala Castle. I recently watched both shows back-to-back so I could analyze the different approaches taken by both and learn some lessons from the Blue's Clues creator. In this article, I share my findings.
Koala Castle was a show that aired on CBS in the late 90s as part of a Saturday morning block called The CBS KidShow. It was aired in the morning from 1990-1991. The show ran for 13 episodes, each episode lasting around 11 minutes. The show is similar in concept to other Saturday morning cartoons at the time. But unlike The Smurfs or Inspector Gadget, Koala Castle felt less generic and more specific. It could easily pass as a show made for modern-day viewers instead of retro watchers, as it introduced characters with personalities and interactions that felt a lot like"

"Short description of Beaver Island by Don Coyhis
When my friends hear me talk about Beaver Island, I am asked, ""How did you find it and what is it like?"" I respond with something like this:
This story begins with my journey as an alcoholic and my recovery path that ultimately led me to Beaver Island. After 25 years in recovery, I was in a unique position to challenge the addiction recovery model as I knew it. I had a healthy career as a substance abuse prevention and treatment professional, and had spent years assisting Native American tribes and various communities to develop and implement alcohol and drug prevention programs.
As an expert in the prevention field, I realized that the prevention model was broken. Evidence-based practices were not being used. There was no real evidence to support many of the programs we were implementing. The recovery rate was very low. And what was even more disturbing was that there was no adequate system of evaluation to actually measure outcomes, an essential component of any health care model.
These deep and powerful questions about alcoholism and its prevention and treatment led me to investigate whether there might be a place on the planet that had an alcoholism-"

Plover has become an indispensable part of the Git for Windows development workflow. You can find more information on our dedicated wiki page.
The project website is located at PloverWeb.com.
Windows version of git (2.18.0 or later)
Known issues and limitations with previous versions of git are documented here.
Why use Plover
When Git for Windows is started for the first time, it sets up its development environment in a hidden directory, the well-known .git directory, which is present in every project folder where you work with Git. The environment contains all the necessary tools to store and track project commits. You use Git to add new commits to your project.
However, Windows is not a Unix system like Linux and macOS. Windows is mostly based on a command-line interface. For example, running git status will print out the status of your repository on the command line. This is useful for developers who are accustomed to working with the command line, but for developers who are more familiar with GUIs, Git for Windows can be confusing.
Plover helps to bridge the gap between the command-line experience and a more familiar graphical environment. Plo"

"Short description of Arowana fish by AquaInfo, including some facts about these beautiful and expensive fish.
Arowanas are tropical, freshwater, bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae. They are also known as Dragon Fish. These fish are well-known for their large size, long life, extraordinary beauty and wealth.
Arowanas are native to the freshwater environments of Southeast Asia, particularly, Borneo, Indonesia, Sumatra, Malaysia and other countries. Osteoglossidae species are fairly unique, with several distinctive features. First of all, they possess bony plates (osteoderms) instead of scales on their bodies, giving them the status of a living fossil.
Second, they can breathe atmospheric air with the help of specialized organs called labyrinth organs. The labyrinth organs allow Arowanas to extract oxygen directly from the air, enabling them to survive in low oxygen waters.
The Arowana fish is slender and elongated, generally attaining a length of 18-24 inches (45-60 cm), although some may grow even larger.

"Short description of Goose Getaway.
Gather your family and friends, visit quaint farm, give them delicious & sumptuous feast, take a short walk or hike along the rolling hills, take a trip on the world’s first steel railroad, or just enjoy the amazing views of the breathtaking sceneries. Goose Getaway is the perfect place for weekend escapes, family gatherings, or team building events.
Went with a group of 9 for a lunch reservation on a rainy Saturday. They did not have a large enough table to accommodate us, so we ended up sitting in the living room which was a bit crowded and uncomfortable. The lunch was very disappointing, with a few people saying that their burgers were dry and one of our guests was served cold fries. The chicken fingers were also cold. Even the waitress' attitude didn't help the experience. We felt like it was a desperate attempt to save money on the quality of food.
After the bad food experience, it was a struggle to even enjoy the beautiful scenery outside.
Horrible experience and not recommended."

"Short description of Frilled Lizard Image and Information.
Lizards, found in diverse habitats around the globe, include a great number of different species that have adapted to their environment. The frilled lizard is one of those species that can be found in various areas like Australia, New Guinea, and the Moluccas. Frilled lizards can grow up to 1.5 meters in length and display a vivid coloration, ranging from red, green, or blue, with yellow or yellowish-brown color on their undersides. The frilled lizard has evolved certain remarkable abilities that help it survive in the harsh environment where it lives. One of its distinct features is the dorsal frill, which is a sheet-like fold of skin located on the back of the lizard's neck. When the lizard feels threatened, it fans out this frill, which acts as a warning sign. Because of its cryptic coloration and the perceived threat from its frill, the lizard will frequently avoid predation.

I saw a Goosander female at the other week on a lake in the forest in Sweden, and it caught my interest. So I looked for more information about the Goosander, and I found these sentences: ""Goosander is mostly black and white plumage with a purple sheen on its head and neck. Its plumage has a distinctive appearance"" and ""The male Goosander has a prominent red bill with a yellow tip"".
At the same time I knew they can grow up to 61cm (24in) in length. I was very surprised about the distinctive appearance and thought, ""I just saw a Goosander female in Sweden this year!"" And I remembered that the Goosander I saw had the same color and pattern as described in the sentences: black and white plumage with a purple sheen on its head and neck.
But I was still missing some information because I didn't see the male Goosander's red bill with a yellow tip on the bird I saw. Unfortunately, I couldn't take any pictures of the Goosander female as I left before I even realized that she was there. But since then I have tried"

"Short description of Piping Plover:
Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), a small migratory bird on the Atlantic coast of North America. The bird, standing around 7 inches tall, has a brown back, white belly and a black neck band. It spends most of its time around the coastal waters and beaches where it feeds on insects, crustaceans and occasionally small fish. The bird generally lays four eggs in a shallow nest on the beach and will fiercely guard its nest from predators. Once the eggs hatch, both parents will care for the chicks until they are independent enough to fend for themselves.
Piping plovers can often be seen running along the beach and sand flats with their characteristic high-stepping gait. Because of their small size, Piping Plover population has decreased significantly due to habitat loss, disturbance and human activity, among other factors. They are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.

As I search my shadowed world, my brain kills me alive
With the darkness pounding in my ears, I feel the beating of a thousand wings
The horror that awaits, a shadow on my wall
It's coming in for the kill, to take me down tonight

The legendary creature known as “Chupacabra” has been one of the most mysterious creatures of folklore, and although the creature has remained largely unknown to the general population, various explanations have tried to explain its origins. It’s a Latin American legend that is supposed to resemble a large hairless dog with sharp spines or quills running down its back. The chupacabra is said to consume the blood and sometimes the flesh of livestock animals such as goats and sheep. With a tendency to kill without actually eating the entire animal, the Chupacabra has gained a reputation for being a brutal and aggressive killer that can’t be stopped by the traditional methods of animal capture, and that has spurred a multitude of theories from extraterrestrial origins to supernatural explanations.

"Short description of Angelfish details
Angelfish description
The term ""Angelfish"" was firstly introduced and used by Darwinist investigator and aquarium inventor Antonius Bary in the 19th century.
This aquatic species of the family Cichlidae is native to the water bodies of Central America.
The body of Angelfish is about 14–18 inches long and the animal weighs around 3–4 pounds. It is grey or silver in color with thick black stripes. Due to the unique characteristics of this fish, it looks quite similar to an angel. That's why it is called angelfish.
A distinct feature of angelfish is that the lower jaw of a male is more elongated than that of a female. This adaptation makes them effective hunters. They can eat algae, shrimps, and other small invertebrates. Angelfish is not a carnivore, but it also occasionally eats plants and algae growing on aquatic plants.
In the natural environment, angelfish sometimes travels in groups or pairs in search of food, and can also get along well with other fish, making them ideal for aquarium life"

Origin of Himalayan Cat
Throughout history, the Siamese (Thai) cat has been extremely popular in England. The Siamese cat’s renown led to a craze for breeding them with other cats, often for the sole purpose of creating a show-winning pet. They were crossed with Persian cats to create the Himalayan.
To emphasize the blue eyes and to develop the striking aqua color, the Himalayan was mated with the Persian, which has solid-colored fur. This breeding produced a combination of the two breeds that bore the name of the Himalayan Cat.

"Short description of Haddock 2016 paper on Frequency Disparity (which this article paraphrases)
Haddock, S. 2016. The effects of the frequency disparity between the components of natural and synthetic waveform datasets on their seismic inversion-based interpretations, presented at the 2016 SEG Conference, Dallas. Haddock examines how the waveform processing and seismic inversion for potential fields (surface and near surface processes) are affected by using a synthetic waveform dataset that is mismatched in frequency to a natural dataset. Additionally, it discusses how these frequency mismatches lead to interpretation errors of reservoir properties in the inverse model, resulting in erroneous geological and geophysical models.
Challenges of using a synthetic dataset to invert natural datasets
Seismic inversion is the process of creating a synthetic model of a subsurface region by utilizing complex mathematical algorithms to transform observed geophysical data into other quantities, such as physical properties of the subsurface (e.g., fluid distributions, rock types, porosity, etc.). This process is often carried out on both a natural dataset and a"

"Short description of Yellow-bellied Sapsucker
Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers are migratory woodpeckers found in North America. Adult males are a beautiful combination of black, white, and red on the head, wings, and tail, while females and juveniles have more subdued colors of gray, black, and white.
The name ""yellow-bellied"" refers to the yellow-orange coloring of their belly, and the word ""sapsucker"" is a perfect description of their feeding habits. These birds make small holes in the bark of trees and then use their long, pointed tongues to extract the sugary sap that flows from those holes.
They eat insects and other small animals, too, but their main diet comes from tree sap. That's why they're commonly found around forests with lots of deciduous trees like maples, aspen, and birch, as these species are full of the sugary sap they prefer. Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers are also known for their distinctive drumming sounds they make while courting and defending their territory, which is done with a sharp, rapid, and regular drumming.

Iguanas are known for their hard and spiny skins that act as their shield against predators. While sharing similarities with lizards and other reptiles, iguanas are different in some ways. One of these differences is that unlike lizards, iguanas mostly spend their lives in trees, rarely leaving them. Iguanas are well known for their long prehensile tails which help them grasp objects.
These long tails of iguanas work as a kind of fifth limb when climbing trees, making it easier for them to get around the treetops. Iguanas are primarily herbivorous, which means they mainly eat plants. Some people have an exaggerated fear of iguanas which is known as iguanodonophobia. You can color these iguana coloring pages in a variety of colors and patterns according to your preference.

"Short description of Grosbeak trapping
Wild birds are trapped using the same techniques as those applied to other wildlife, except in the case of species like Woodpeckers and Nuthatches, which require a slightly different method. We use mainly mist nets to catch birds, though padded nets and snares are also employed depending on the species involved. The procedure involves setting the nets in a known area where the birds are known to inhabit and baiting them with food. The trapped animals are then extracted and released in the wild after determining their health, age, and sex in the case of males, using colour bands.
The practice of trapping wild birds in order to study their anatomy and identify features such as age, health, and sex is known as banding. This process is highly beneficial to research and environmental conservation since it allows individuals to study population trends, monitor health, and evaluate how environmental conditions impact wildlife. There is also an international database on the movements of banded birds, which is a powerful tool to understand the dispersal of wild birds. In the case of some bird species, it is difficult to determine the age or sex of the individual by appearance alone. Coloured bands are therefore used on"

"Short description of Sunbittern:
The sunbittern, or sometimes called horned screamer, is a bird that belongs to the family of cranes and herons. They can be found from the coastal mangrove swamps of Costa Rica to the savannas of central Brazil and Argentina, living in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats like swamps, marshes, and lake edges.

They also have long, trailing black and yellow legs. Both sexes are similar in size and appearance, but the males display a head crest of feathers (6-8 inches long) when threatened or during courtship displays.
These birds use their large size, bright colors, and crested feathers as a deterrent to predators like owls, eagles, and hawks. Males and females usually forage in pairs, quietly looking for insects and small fish. They also use their long legs to wade"

"Short description of Wildebeest migration
The largest mammal migration on the planet and one of the greatest natural wonders, the Great Wildebeest Migration occurs in the Serengeti-Masai Mara ecosystem, comprising Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
At least 1.3 million wildebeest, supported by around 200,000 zebras and 400,000 gazelles, move in a clockwise direction in search of fresh grass following the rains. They are followed by their predators, particularly lions and hyenas, and it is estimated that over 250,000 wildebeest do not complete the journey.
Annually, the migration moves in a predictable pattern. The journey takes between six and eight months depending on the rainfall and timing of the migration. Generally, the wildebeest begin to move from the southern plains in the Serengeti around November/December and follow the long rains through the central and northern plains of the Serengeti and then into the Masai Mara in Kenya around June."

"Short description of Beetle Bailey
Beetle Bailey was a well-loved American comic strip that was written and drawn by the artist Mort Walker. The story itself tells about a fictional character by the name of Beetle Bailey, a private in the United States Army, stationed at Fort Snuffy, where he is known to frequent the officers' club with his pals and steal kisses from a singer. The comic strip first appeared in print on September 4, 1950.
Since then, the comic strip evolved over the years to adapt to different changes that occurred in the world.
In 1982, the main focus was changed to Beetle Bailey's wife, Lois, as the artists wanted to make her a strong character who speaks her mind.
After Mort Walker passed away in January 2018, the comic strip continued in a new style with four other artists taking over the task of creating new adventures for Beetle Bailey.

Booby Bump started with a simple idea and it evolved into an awesome sense of community that shares a mutual passion for funky music, original art, and kickass events. Created by Rees Curet, the idea was to help the bands he managed to get in front of larger audiences and get them more gigs.
To accomplish this, Rees started throwing “backyard” parties in Dallas, TX that featured bands he managed, artists he represented, and musicians he worked with on a regular basis. The parties started to grow and before Rees knew it, the parties and his clients became “hot tickets” in the Dallas music and art scenes.
Over the past 10 years, the Booby Bump team has continued to produce unique events, focusing on live music and art, that has attracted a diverse group of party people from all around the world.
Currently, our events are focused on Denton, TX, but we have our sights set on expanding across the country, presenting fans of all stripes with exciting and inspiring events featuring emerging and established artists, musicians, and performers.

"Short description of Paddlefish
Paddlefish are a large and distinctive species of fish, best known for their elongated rostrum (or snout) which can often be longer than their body. Their long rostrum, covered with sensory cells that are useful in detecting food and underwater objects, is the reason for their species’ name. They live in freshwater rivers and lakes and are mainly found in North America. Paddlefish are primarily filter feeders, consuming zooplankton and aquatic insects, and are considered critically endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and dam construction.
Paddlefish’s original name: Polyodon spathula
Evolutionary classification of Paddlefish: The closest family of Paddlefish is the Acipenseridae family. Acipenseridae means ‘Acipenser’, which is the word for the genus that includes paddlefish and their relatives, and ‘-idae’ is the term for the biological classification of a family.

Planning your next gorilla trek? Make sure you know what you need to do and the costs involved.
“Mountain gorillas are highly sensitive to human diseases. When they have any kind of infection, they can easily die. So, it is for their protection as well as yours, that you need to follow the guidelines laid out for you by your ranger,” Kevin explains.
These gorillas are rare and endangered animals that are closely related to humans (they share around 98% of our DNA). In the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, the gorillas are assigned their own team of rangers who keep a close watch on them, they are also habituated to human presence and this is where humans can get close enough to see them.
The gorillas are divided into groups and each gorilla group is led by a silverback, an adult male with a large silvery patch on its back. Aside from their numbers in the park, they also require space and thus only eight visitors are allowed to visit a single group daily for an hour. Visitors are expected to observe from at least seven meters away, but the ranger"

"Short description of Black Skimmer. By Bill Thompson III
The black skimmer has a unique appearance: long, slender bill, sharp wings and curved neck. They hunt by flying low over the water, with the lower mandible of their bill only a few inches above the surface, and that unique appearance with its long neck and legs make it one of the more recognizable wading birds around the coasts of North and South America. When the skimmer has found a fish, it snaps its bill shut to trap the unsuspecting prey. Then the bird flies away from the water and catches its breath for a few seconds before proceeding with its patented fishing technique.
The black skimmer nests on beaches and sandbars, with burrows dug into the sandy banks of tidal creeks. This species is not seriously threatened, at least not yet, but large-scale destruction of coastal habitats and pollution problems could be potential threats in the future. In 1996, the black skimmer was the subject of an incidental catch that killed 50,000 individuals when a fishing operation in Bolivia accidentally netted them. Sadly, at present, an estimated"

"Short description of Albatross Expendable Launch Vehicle
The Albatross was to be an expendable launch vehicle developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, designed to provide rideshare or dedicated launches to lower-earth orbit (LEO). The Albatross was proposed in the mid-1990s as a development project based upon the Pegasus XL vehicle, using both air-launch and ground-launch capabilities. The Pegasus XL, itself a derivative of the original Pegasus launch system, is a medium-class rocket designed to launch multiple payloads of up to 1,100 kg into low-earth orbit. For the Albatross, the vehicle would have used new first and second stages, and potentially be capable of delivering 5,500 kg into LEO. The project was not developed further, however, due to lack of funding, causing the Pegasus XL program to continue without a competing expendable launch vehicle.

The Barn Swallow is a familiar sight for many people, often seen swooping around houses, fields and along waterways, gathering insects from the air with its distinctive forked tail. Their most striking feature is their beautiful dark blue to violet-blue back and wings, which make them easy to identify. They have long swept-back wings and a notched tail. Their breast is red, sometimes with some brown on the flanks, and their belly is white. The bill is short and dark, and the feet are dark grey. In flight, their long wings make a gentle, raspy whisper.
Description of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) status in Denmark
The Barn Swallow population in Denmark is a relatively stable and robust one. However, in recent years there have been changes due to climate change and habitat loss. Many of Denmark's best nesting sites are used for agriculture, and as a result, swallows are forced to look for new nesting locations. This can sometimes lead to breeding failures and increased competition for other nest sites, making it harder for the Barn Swallow to breed successfully."

Despite being at the show ring, Clumber Spaniels are tough dogs used for game hunting. Dogs of this breed have an impressive height, being larger than other spaniel breeds.

In the water, Clumber Spaniels can feel disoriented and thus cannot swim on purpose or enjoy it. However, it is not essential for the dog to have special training for swimming in water.
But in general, these dogs do not like to be in the water, as they are prone to seasonal allergies, which worsen when they come into contact with water. The coat of these dogs is not very waterproof and can stick to their body when wet, causing them significant discomfort.

This elongated bony fish has a silvery or blue-green color and a crest of long, slender pointed fins that extend from the head to the tail. Oarfish have a flexible, soft, tubular body with a pattern of reddish-brown stripes that give it an appealing appearance. They have no scales and are, therefore, considered scaleless fish.
Oarfish live in deep waters, ranging between 200 to 1,000 meters (656-3,280 feet). They are rarely seen at the surface, and when they do emerge, they are sometimes mistaken for sea ser"

The California Condor is the largest soaring bird in North America. These impressive birds measure 45 inches (114 cm) from head to tail and have a wingspan of over 9 feet (2.74 meters). They are mostly black in color, and their necks and heads are a contrasting lighter hue. Their bodies are covered in a golden-brown color, which gives them a beautiful glossy appearance.

"Short description of Termite damage. What is Termite Damage?
Every year, termites cause over $5 billion in damages to property in the United States alone. Most of that damage occurs in the south, where termites are more prevalent. Termites are attracted to wood and other cellulose materials, which they consume as food. Over time, the constant feeding of termites causes significant damage to wood structures such as homes, decks, fences, and more.
There are a few different ways that termites can cause damage to a property. One way is by consuming the wood, which weakens the structure. Another way is by building tunnels and galleries in the wood, further weakening it. Termites also produce galleries and tunnels, which can cause structural issues. Finally, termites can cause damage by their droppings, which can stain surfaces.
Although termites are often thought of as a Southern issue, they can be found in all 50 states. It's important to be aware of the signs of termites so that you can take action to prevent or address damage to your property. If you suspect termite damage, contact a professional exterminator for an inspection"

"Short description of Egret
Egrets are medium to large, wading birds of the family Ardeidae. They are called egrets or aigrettes in English, the term deriving from the French aigrette, meaning a 'tuft'. The process by which the plumage of many egrets, particularly the highly prized _B. alba_ of the Old World, was cleaned during moulting is fascinating, and one of the 'peculiarities' that made these birds highly sought after as status symbols by many people.
A final note on this subject: egrets and herons belong to the order Ciconiiformes, which also includes storks, spoonbills, ibises and spoonbills, and their family name, Ardeidae, is shared with other related families (e.g. Threskiornithidae, Balaenicipitidae, Scopidae).

"Short description of Water Buffalo Racing in Nepal
In the Far Western Region of Nepal there are many festivals where buffalo races are held. Most of these are in Bajura district, for example the festival held in Bauma Punjara on the 18th of February 2016. These events are not for entertainment, they are organised by farmers to pray for a good harvest, good health and prosperity. The races can be emotional because all the buffaloes involved are household buffaloes that belong to the participating farmers. A prize is given for the best male and female buffaloes that have performed best in their age category.
However, for many, this is not only an opportunity to pray for a good harvest, but also an opportunity to go head to head with rivals and show off their skills and buffaloes in an environment where these talents might normally not be appreciated.
The competitors form two lines, often organised by age and with the farmers riding the buffaloes in front of their own line. The farmers give the signal to start and they sprint to the finish line, pulling a small wooden stick attached to a wheel or wooden pin with their teeth"
"Short description of Irukandji Jellyfish
This extremely dangerous animal is one of the smallest jellyfish in the world. Its transparent body is barely 2.5 cm (1 in) in size and it has tentacles up to 15 cm (6 in) long. It is found in Australian waters, especially around the Great Barrier Reef. It is similar in appearance to another jellyfish, the cubozoan, but it is very difficult to identify between the two.
It has two different types of poison: ""Type 1"", which is distributed along the tentacles and affects the nervous system, and ""Type 2"", which is distributed in the jellyfish's body and also affects the nervous system.
The symptoms of a sting are quite different from those produced by other jellyfish, such as nausea, vomiting, intense pain, muscle spasms, and disorientation, often with cardiac arrest. If you are bitten, you should seek urgent medical help.
To avoid being stung by this animal, protect your arms and legs with a diving suit or wet suit and gloves when swimming in the ocean. Always avoid touching suspicious jellyfish."

Which are the best species of Darwins Frog you can buy?
How long do Darwins Frog live?
There are no 100% correct or incorrect answers to the question of whether Darwin's frogs are easy to maintain or difficult to maintain. As with any other pet, the level of difficulty depends on the individual's level of care and commitment to providing the best possible environment for the animal.
In general, Darwin's frogs do not require a lot of effort, and maintaining their care is quite simple. They are hardy animals that do not require a lot of care and are suitable for beginners who wish to start with a smaller species.
Darwin's frogs should be kept in a humid terrarium or aquarium with a substrate that is able to hold moisture. The temperature should be kept at around 6"

The male Grackle sports iridescent blue-black feathers and is often mistaken for a crow, distinguishing itself with its long, sinuous neck and pale lores (the skin between its eye and beak).

The typical length of this bird is about 11.4 cm (4.5 inches) and its wingspan varies from 16 to 19.1 cm (6.3 to 7.5 inches). With its bright colors, the House Wren appears like a jewel for the inquisitive eyes of birdwatchers and ornithologists, which makes it one of the most appreciated and well-known birds of this region of North America. However, this wren is more known for its unlimited zeal to defend its territory than its beauty, being a very territorial bird.

"Short description of Chondrichthyes
The name “Chondrichthyes” is derived from the Greek “chondros” meaning cartilage and “ichthys” meaning fish. This class is distinguished from other vertebrates by the presence of scales and cartilaginous rather than bony skeletons. They are a group of fishes that form the class Chondrichthyes, which includes sharks and rays. Chondrichthyes is further classified into two subclasses: Holocephali (which includes the sharks that have a full-headed skull) and Elasmobranchii (which includes the sharks with a modified skull).
Key reproductive characteristics of Chondrichthyes
There are various reproductive characteristics that can be used to distinguish Chondrichthyes from other vertebrates. Some of these characteristics include:
Internal fertilization – In Chondrichthyes, the fertilization process occurs within the body of the female rather than externally, as is the case in most other vertebrates. This is an advantage for them, as it allows them to maintain a higher level of control over their offspring’s development and improve the chances of successful reproduction"

"Short description of Tiger Barb (Barbus tetrazona)
Barbus tetrazona, also known as the Tiger Barb, is a charming, small, and vividly-colored freshwater fish. It originates from the Mekong and Chao Phraya basins in Southeast Asia.
In their natural environment, these fish can be found in slow-flowing, warm water near the bottoms of rivers, lakes, and ponds. When kept as a pet, they should be housed in a similarly-tempered aquarium with plenty of hiding spaces, caves, or plants.
These fish are relatively peaceful and thrive in groups of three or more, which encourages them to showcase their intricate, colorful patterns.
Tiger Barbs are an excellent addition to any community aquarium as long as the tank is large enough to accommodate them. They can be housed with other peaceful fish, but be careful not to combine them with aggressive fish, as they might be intimidated.

Barn owls are widely known as being nocturnal hunters. This is largely because of their light, beautifully nuanced appearance, when seen against a dark sky. These fascinating creatures are equally at home during the day when it is considerably brighter and, of course, at night. Given this, it should be unsurprising that, with better nighttime optics, barn owls are just as spectacular to observe at night as they are during the day.
For this, there are several benefits of having barn owl binoculars. While these are primarily used to get closer to the subject during the day when they are more active, a pair of barn owl binoculars can help you better observe their behaviour during the evening too. These are ideal binoculars for birdwatching and wildlife enthusiasts who wish to get up close to barn owls and their environment.

"Short description of Stoat Trap
We hunt stoats using the lure of a rabbit skin. This rodent is placed near the runway with the intention of attracting a stoat. The best results are achieved by placing the skinned rabbit near the dens and the passage of stoats. Once a predator has arrived, it will trigger the trap that will cause the stoat to get entangled. The wire is tightened and the stoat caught. Our experience, after years of work, has taught us that the best way to catch a stoat is by using the skinned rabbit as bait and not a live one, as it is commonly thought.
Stoats are the most dangerous predator in any ecosystem inhabited by mice and rabbits, but do not pose any threat to human beings or animals that are larger than them. It is a small, long-legged member of the weasel family. The stoat has a slender, elongated body, a long and flexible tail, and small, round eyes set in a broad, flat head. The stoat hunts mainly in ditches, under bushes, or along the edges of the woods. In the height of the bre"

"Short description of Weaver Birds
Weaver Birds are members of the Passerine order and the Ploceidae family. Weaver birds or, in technical terms, weavers, get their name from their remarkable nest-building skills. Some weavers are endemic to the Indian Subcontinent, while others are residents of other countries in Africa and, to a lesser extent, Madagascar and parts of Southeast Asia. A bird, the Weaver, is called a significant cluster-nest builder. The word 'Weaver' refers to their nest-making abilities, not the bird's position within the family structure.
So let us now delve deeper into the world of Weaver Birds and learn more about these species with remarkable nest-building talents and interesting features.

"Short description of Oystercatcher
The Black-bellied Sandgrouse, a bird widely distributed in the scrublands of Asia, has been a victim of illegal hunting since the 1970s. Because of its large, round body and preference for open, arid landscapes, it was considered a tasty prey item by people who still rely on wild meat for their diet.
Despite various conservation measures, including bans on hunting and translocation programs to support its breeding, the Black-bellied Sandgrouse population has continued to decline, making the species vulnerable to extinction. In order to bring this species back from the brink, concerted conservation efforts are needed to tackle both illegal hunting and habitat loss, which may be exacerbated by climate change.
Life expectancy of Oystercatcher
The life expectancy of an Oystercatcher is around 20 years in the wild.

Book: Squid Modern and Biology
Recently the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) started to spawn later. We know from past studies (Czeschel, 2004) that in most cases climate plays a crucial role in determining the length of the reproductive period and other aspects of the life cycle of Antarctic krill (Fig. 1). This new study (Jackson, 2008) makes use of data recorded by satellites that can not only calculate the phytoplankton biomass in the Antarctic, but also the extent of its geographic distribution. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that there has been an overall decline in Antarctic phytoplankton productivity, which is directly correlated to climate change. Climate change leading to environmental changes, such as the lengthening of the polar night and increases in sea ice cover, would in turn lead to nutritional changes in the diet of the Antarctic krill, especially if the total biomass of their main food, phytoplankton, decreases"

"Short description of Grizzly Bear Removal program, British Columbia.
The Government of British Columbia's Grizzly Bear Removal Program is a multi-year effort to reduce potential bear-human conflicts within the province's backcountry. The program's purpose is to ensure that these important animals are not directly targeted for eradication, but instead to reduce the likelihood of these animals interacting with humans.
The program focuses on removing bears that have shown repeated patterns of aggression and problem behavior, rather than bears that simply exhibit routine feeding behavior. Bears removed are captured using tranquilizers and then relocated to new, more secure locations.
The removal process is administered through the Wildlife Branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resources, in collaboration with local wildlife organizations and regional conservation groups.
The Grizzly Bear Removal Program uses a graduated approach wherein additional steps are taken to protect both the human public and the bears themselves. The following measures are in place to prevent negative bear-human encounters:
1. Education: Government, conservation organizations and other groups work to educate the public about the co-existence of bears and people in British Columbia."

"Short description of Horseshoe Crab.
This picture (right) shows the Horseshoe Crab species Limulus polyphemus. These “living fossils” have a fascinating evolutionary history as they appeared relatively unchanged for more than 200 million years. While they are not true crabs, they resemble crabs in shape and structure.
The Horseshoe Crab is frequently used as a biological model in the field of drug testing, as its blood contains a naturally occurring substance that can detect the presence of certain bacterial endotoxins. This blood also has a variety of other applications, including in research and cancer therapies, but non-medical harvesting of this species is subject to strict regulations."
"Short description of Rabbit Education and Training:
The doe is working to house-train her rabbit. When the doe has taught her rabbit to use the box, she will change the rabbit's litter from newspaper to wood shavings or other litters preferred by the rabbit. Because rabbits like clean bedding, it is important to have clean litter boxes.
Rabbit Education and Training Issue:
One problem is the rabbit's lack of control during elimination. For this problem, the doe will teach the rabbit to hold its urine and feces, allowing it to be placed in a litter box to meet the rabbit's needs for cleanliness. Once the rabbit has been trained, the doe will need to place a litter box near the rabbit's resting area.
How to solve the Rabbit Education and Training issue:
To train the rabbit, the doe should carry the rabbit to its litter box and place it inside. She will then say, ""Go potty,"" and the rabbit will know to do its business in the litter box. If the rabbit hasn't eliminated within a few minutes, the doe"

"Short description of Yellow Warbler:

Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia, Dendroica aestiva) is a small, insectivorous songbird found throughout most of North America. These colorful birds spend winters in Central and South America. Yellow Warblers have distinct yellow underparts and throats, and their dull olive-brown upper parts are streaked with darker brown feathers. Their wings are dark with two bright white bars on each one. They breed in open areas and woodlands across most of North America. Females choose the nesting site, and males guard the territory. Yellow Warblers build their nests in shrubs or on the ground, lining the interior with leaves and grasses. Both the male and the female participate in building the nest, which takes around 3 days to complete. Each nesting pair raises 1-4 chicks. Yellow Warblers forage among branches, bushes, and trees, catching insects on the wing or picking them off leaves. They also eat insects by gleaning them from tree trunks and the ground. These small birds are common and not threatened.

"Short description of Archerfish -- Lab: Bragi
Archerfish (Toxotes jaculatrix) is a widely spread fish species throughout freshwater and brackish waters of South East Asia. This species exhibits a unique, highly sophisticated hunting behaviour which is of interest for researchers all over the world. Archerfish detect and attack insects on top of submerged vegetation using their ""squirt gun"", an elongated tongue which can propel water at high speeds (up to 3 m/s) to knock down prey.
Sophisticated eye-tracking techniques and mathematical models allow us to study hunting behaviour of archerfish from different perspectives, from ecological and evolutionary questions to neurological processes. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms for the archerfish hunting strategy might offer insights for robotics and the automation of complex tasks in general.

"Short description of Southern Flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma)
The Southern Flounder has a oval-shaped body with both eyes located on the left side and a medium-sized mouth. Its body coloration can range from brown or gray to black with numerous small white spots.
The Southern Flounder is found on sandy bottoms in estuaries and near coastal areas in the western Atlantic Ocean.
The Southern Flounder feeds mainly on small fish and crustaceans.
Reproduction occurs between February and April, with both male and female Southern Flounder releasing eggs into the water column. The eggs are fertilized externally and then settled on the bottom, where they are left to develop until they hatch. The hatching process usually takes two to three days. After hatching, the young flounders settle on the ocean floor and eventually develop the typical left-side positioning of both eyes characteristic of adults.
The Southern Flounder can grow to 13 inches in length and weigh up to 2.5 pounds."
"Short description of Long-Eared Owl
The Long-Eared Owl belongs to the same family as the Short-eared Owls, Horned Owls and Snowy Owls.

"Short description of African Rock Python - When environmental activists discovered evidence of poaching in South Africa's Kruger National Park, rangers conducted a night raid to try to catch the culprits. The search was rewarded by the discovery of a pile of snares filled with the bones of many animals, apparently left behind by the poachers. A closer look at the items in the snares led the rangers to a surprising discovery.
The person had been lured by a false promise of a reward. This individual had attempted to catch 22 African rock pythons, one of the largest snakes in Africa, which they might sell to wildlife traders for a large profit. Rangers allowed the individual to remove a few of the pythons before releasing the rest back into the wild.
While the rangers couldn't prove that the poacher was working in conjunction with the wildlife traders, they believe there may be a connection.
The African Rock Python is a non-venomous constrictor. It grows up to a length of 20 feet (6 meters) and can reach a weight of 220 pounds (100 kilograms). It is an opportunistic"

"Short description of Emperor Penguin species:
This species has almost all characteristics of a bird species, although it is a penguin species which is covered by an extraordinary share of feathering. Emperor penguins are found solely in the Antarctic area, although they are quite tolerant of cold climate. They are also social animals that are fond of gathering in various groups. As a result, this species has a large population.
One of the distinct features of emperor penguins is their high feeding efficiency, with the help of a powerful and strong set of beaks which they use to catch fishes. This penguin species is best known for the extreme distances they cover on foot during their breeding period. In addition to that, their very special reproductive technique involving a female penguin laying its egg on its feet and transferring it to the male penguin’s feet, is also well known.
Except for the fact that the emperor penguins are not tolerant to very high temperatures and are sensitive to human presence in their breeding grounds, they are quite resistant species.

"Short description of Leopard Gecko Morphs
Leopard gecko morphs are the various genetic variations of leopard geckos that exist due to selective breeding over the years. As a result, breeders have created an immense amount of color and pattern variations of leopard geckos.
These morphs are mainly categorized by the colors and patterns exhibited on their skin. Some leopard geckos, for instance, possess a high level of melanin, giving them a darker appearance, while others showcase little to no melanin, making them appear very light or even colorless.
Additionally, leopard geckos can come in various pattern variations, such as striped or blotched. It’s important to note that the reptile’s sex chromosomes don’t play a role in the color and pattern variations seen in leopard gecko morphs.
Breeders have achieved these morphs through selective breeding. Hence, the morphs are not a result of gene mutations.

Arctic Wolf is a large wolf with a distinctive white coat of fur, often seen as the figurehead and mascot of the Viking Ice Hockey team.
Wolves have been present in North American Arctic regions for thousands of years, their ancestors originating from Eurasia via the Bering Land Bridge. The Arctic wolves now live primarily in Canada, which includes Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. They tend to live in packs, helping them hunt various prey such as caribou, muskox, and hares, often pursuing these animals in large numbers. Their diet may change seasonally, and they are known for their remarkable hunting skills.
Often hunted for their fur, which is highly valued, the Arctic Wolf is listed as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, conservation efforts have led to an increase in their numbers in some areas.
